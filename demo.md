#### Sixth Section

##### This section is intended to create diagrams

- This is a map with the source code from: [GeoJSON](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#using-geojson)

```geojson
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": 1,
      "properties": {
        "ID": 0
      },
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Polygon",
        "coordinates": [
          [
              [-90,35],
              [-90,30],
              [-85,30],
              [-85,35],
              [-90,35]
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- This is an example using [STL 3D Models](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-stl-3d-models)

```stl
solid cube_corner
  facet normal 0.0 -1.0 0.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.0 0.0 -1.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal -1.0 0.0 0.0
    outer loop
      vertex 0.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
      vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
    endloop
  endfacet
  facet normal 0.577 0.577 0.577
    outer loop
      vertex 1.0 0.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 1.0 0.0
      vertex 0.0 0.0 1.0
    endloop
  endfacet
endsolid
```

- This is the simplest diagram so far

```mermaid

    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    A-->E;
    B-->D;
    B-->E;
    C-->D;

    E-->F;
```
